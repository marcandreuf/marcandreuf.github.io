I am an experienced full-stack developer interested in Software Quality and Application Security.
In the past, I have worked with JAVA, PHP, Node.js, and Python, and lately, I have been hacking and learning more about AI. I also like implementing automated tools and DevOps pipelines to enhance efficiencies and code quality.
I am all about self-hosting and home-lab tinkering.

My hobbies are ethical hacking, coding, reading, playing football and DIY electronics.

## Who am I:

I am a husband, father of two formidable boys and a technologist geek in my free time. 

## What I have worked on:
I have been working professionally as a software engineer since 2004. I have started as a web developer. Since then, I have narrowed my specialisation from a general front and back-end developer toward quality assurance and automation testing. 

**Lately, I have discovered more about applied AI Automation and Application Security Testing.**

Throughout my career, I have had the chance to learn a lot from legacy code solutions. In addition, I have seen the pains and overwhelming costs of destructive processes and coding practices. **As a result, I now have a pragmatic sense of software quality that works across different programming languages and technologies.**

I have worked professionally in various sectors, including banking, ticketing systems, mobile applications, online gaming, retail websites, and more. 

I have also had the chance to train many colleagues along the way. I like teaching and collaborating to get things done straightforwardly and efficiently. 

## What I love:
I love home labs, where I can hack with DIY electronics, integration systems, communication protocols, and other high-end user development and testing frameworks. 

I thrive working directly with business owners, clients, and managers who care about the end-user experience. I have years of experience in this mindset, so I understand the value of defining a vision into an actionable roadmap and its features.

## My Motto:

> **If we can simplify something useful for the mid/long term, do it; it results in compounded gains.**

## My Mission:

> **Quality Inside. I fix problems to improve quality from within.**
