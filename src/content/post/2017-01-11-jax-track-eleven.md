## Overview

Session: [13th Oct -- 9:00 to 17:00 Applying DDD at pace for Effective Microservices](https://jaxlondon.com/session/applying-ddd-at-pace-for-effective-microservices/) by [Russ Miles](http://www.russmiles.com/), [Atomist](https://www.atomist.com/)

## Notes
This was a workshop session. During the morning Russ performed a master lesson about how to prepare our mind towards Mirco-services solutions. Here I present just some of the hotkey concepts of the theoretical part of the session.

-   **Anti-fragile is the core concept behind Micro-services. Embrace change.**
-   Do not aim for the right / best solution, rather **aim for the seed of an evolving organism.**
-   **Describe the system by its events only.** Consider the things that happen in order to find the events of a system. Create a ubiquitous language not about the entities of the model, but about the events between those entities.
-   Use a more scientific method approach.
-   Events are immutable. They must be logged and persisted.
-   Find meaningful event names.
-   Avoid acronyms, they are an impediment to communication.
-   **Avoid code names for systems, rather describe what the system does.**
-   Apply single responsibility principle for events.
-   Good names come from meetings with stakeholders while describing the system.
-   **Find the causality of events. The flow of events as they trigger other events.**
-   Define the bounded context. The context where the team can know what happens, what are the events and the team can evolve the solution all based on internal/technical reasons.

The workshop was much more fun than this list of concepts. Russ is a top-level speaker and I even would say he reaches the level to be a Technologist Philosopher with well rooted and practical principles. It is hard to summarise all the content that he delivered in this session. Probably would be much better to keep an open eye and attend to the next Miles's master session.

That was all for this session.
