## Overview

11th Oct -- 09:00 -- 09:45 Java for Cloud Natives

-   In summary, the quote about where is JAVA nowadays was:

> "Java is growing and expanding as companies mature over time"

-   [5 things we learned from James Governor, RedMonk](https://jaxenter.com/129566-129566.html)

## Main ideas

1. We're all foragers now: Now we have to build or configure our own tooling.

2. We need to invest in people: Use people's brain, make them grow within the organization.

3. Open source is the new normal: Use and contribute to open source is the preferred development style.

4. Everyone should be using continuous integration in modern software development.

5. The tapas table metaphor --- Break your monolithic team into small teams to build great things. The number of frameworks in Java is growing at a fast rate.
