## Overview

Session: [11th Oct -- 16:45 to 17:35  Euphoria despite the Despair -- (Re)discovering the joy of being a software engineer](https://jaxlondon.com/session/euphoria-despite-the-despair-rediscovering-the-joy-of-being-a-software-engineer/) by Holly Cummins, [IBM Bluemix Garage Method](https://www.ibm.com/devops/method/) & Martijn Verburg, [JClarity](https://www.jclarity.com/index.php)

## Notes

This was possibly one of the most important sessions of the event.

The key component towards successful projects is not technology stack but rather happy developers.

-   How to build a highly effective culture for software development.
    -   All details in the [BGM paper](http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=WH&infotype=SA&htmlfid=APW12350USEN&attachment=APW12350USEN.PDF&ce=ISM0056&ct=swg&cmp=ibmsocial&cm=h&cr=crossbrand&ccy=us)
-   Killing or preventing fun culture:
    -   Apply the [SMART goals](http://www.briantracy.com/blog/leadership-success/5-tips-for-motivating-employees-smart-goal-setting-for-managers/) to motivate people. **Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bounded.**
    -   Inability to produce good software
    -   **Waterfall development method is not fun.\
        **

> **"Water-fall is not working!"**

-   -   Developers have fun when writing new features. "Fun with the WHAT"
    -   Testers have fun finding bugs, doing code reviews and working to improve the solution. "Fun with the HOW"
    -   Happiness promotes career development, less sick days and more productivity.
        -   Watching one video about [cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EIbWjkimAs), [lego trains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEekXRNztVI), ... increases quality and productivity.
    -   Important! Fun needs to be for the team, not only for me!
    -   Coding is fun!
    -   **Meetings "sucks"**
        -   jClarity has metrics of 90% coding time
    -   Promoting pair programming and more daily collaboration.
        -   STOP DOING CODE REVIEWS! Or at least minimise the waste of time by learning the basics of code review "[Devoxx: How to stop wasting your time and start performing useful code reviews by Maria Khalusova](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRnMzMpSeag)"
    -   No estimates!
        -   **Estimation in hours is dead**, in story points there is minimum benefits for the team productivity.
    -   Let technical people make their own decisions.
        -   Make people responsible.

That was all for this session.
